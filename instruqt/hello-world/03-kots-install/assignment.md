In the previous challenge you already copied the installation command for an existing cluster:

curl https://kots.io/install | bash
kubectl kots install [YOUR-APP-NAME]/helloworld
```

Run this command in the `Shell` tab and give it a `namespace` name of your choice:

```
$> kubectl kots install [YOUR-APP-NAME]/helloworld
Enter the namespace to deploy to:
```

When asked for a password, provide a secure password and remember it as it will be needed in the next Challenge.
