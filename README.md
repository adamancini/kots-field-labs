Replicated Field Labs
========================

Labs resources are the fastest way to get you hands on learning Replicated technology.
The labs are hands-on field training with KOTS and the KOTS troubleshooting toolset.

**Why do we offer it?** Provides your team the quickest way to learn our technology. If your team decides it is not the right tech, it saves your team time that would otherwise be spent in a time consuming POC.

**How do we do this?** We use Instruqt to give each participant their own environment to learn. We can schedule office hours and onsite workshops to ensure we are there to answer any questions.

Please let us know when you would like to schedule this!

FYI: You will need an invite from Replicated in order to access the hands-on labs.
